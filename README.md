# Advanced Programming in C++

In this workshop, we will introduce you to the C++ programming language,
explore advanced programming techniques, work with fundamental data structures
and algorithms, and apply these tools to solving complex problems.

## Cloning

You should be able to simply clone this repo or download this specific projects
you want from GitHub. The repo will be updated weekly.

## Prerequisites

While everyone is welcomed to attend and participate in this workshop, it is
recommended that students have a knowledge of basic programming concepts (in
any programming language). If you’ve seen basic control structures (loops, if
statements, etc.), variables, arrays, and program decomposition, then you
should be ready to take this workshop.

## Course Website + Slack

Course materials, handouts and relevant resources will be posted on the
workshop’s website located at www.cadtexas.com/workshop/cplusplus. In addition,
we will be using Slack to post announcements and answer questions throughout
the semester. You will be invited to join the Slack group after the first week
of class.

## Readings

The suggested textbooks for this workshop are: Primary: Eric Roberts'
Programming Abstractions in C++ Supplementary: Nicolai M. Josuttis’ The C++
Standard Library Note: Electronic versions will be posted on our website.

## Required Software

This workshop will support all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). We
will provide handouts describing how to get a C++ development environment set
up on your machines. It is recommended that you bring your personal laptop to
class as we will be working on programming assignments during lectures.
