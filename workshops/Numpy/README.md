# Numpy Exercises

## Exercise 1
A list `baseball` has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a `numpy` array from it?

### Instructions

* Import the `numpy` package as `np`, so that you can refer to `numpy` with `np`.
* Use [`np.array()`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/glossary.html#term-array) to create a `numpy` array from `baseball`. Name this array `np_baseball`.
* Print out the type of `np_baseball` to check that you got it right.

`@sample_code`
```python
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Import the numpy package as np


# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball


# Print out type of np_baseball

```
